# [EVEmu](https://evemu.dev) - An EVE Online Emulator

## Introduction
EVEmu is a work-in-progress server emulator for the space MMO EVE Online. This is an educational project. Please see the disclaimer below for details.

## ChangeLog
[ChangeLog](doc/ChangeLog.md)

## TODO (Systems requiring implementation and rework)
- Missions / Agents
- Fleet
- POS
- Planetary Interaction

## `docker-compose` Quickstart
 EVEmu can be run with Docker Compose:
```
git clone https://github.com/evemuproject/evemu_server.git
cd evemu_server
docker-compose -p evemu up -d
```
**NOTE:** Add `--build` to the `docker-compose up` command to force a rebuild of the source. This is useful when making code changes.

By changing `build:` to `image:` in `docker-compose.yml`, you can use the prebuilt images available.

Configuraiton files are stored in the `evemu_config` volume. These can be modified and will persist across restarts.

To shutdown EVEmu:
```
docker-compose -p evemu down
```

## Building with Docker
 EVEmu can now be built with docker to ensure a consistent dependency base. This can be done by executing `docker build .` in the root directory.
 It is highly suggested to build EVEmu from the latest release available on the releases page.
