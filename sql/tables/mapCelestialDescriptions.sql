Regardless, I promise to return to you soon.\n\nHeloise: The facilities here are astounding! Our host has assembled a team of the finest minds to bring his dream to life. They have made major strides-- the implications of their cranial implant technology alone are dazzling.\n\nHeloise: Our host introduced what became of the slaves I delivered. The brutes were silent and inert. I tell you, it was as if their very souls had been stripped from them. I will voice my concerns with our host tomorrow. \n\nHeloise: Our host announced the birth of his \'Nation.\' I sent a communique to the Ministry of Internal Order.\n\nHeloise: I discovered my messages are being blocked. Our host never had any intention of sending them. His automatons are everywhere now. Their number grows every day. They are watching me.\n\nMy Darling Wife: How I miss you. The slaves have been set against everyone not of the Nation. I survived only by grace. The things are slow, but efficient. I hear their footsteps pass the room, regular, constant.

Comprised mainly of engineers and physicists, the Arithmetics sought to use naturally occurring phenomena and mathematical permutations thereof to dictate a \"pure\" clock. During this time, the region now known as Period Basis was an area of intensive research. The region\'s inordinately high concentration of pulsars of various frequencies led the physicists to try to find some lowest common denominator among the harmonics, or in the common parlance of astronomer Callentus Holzine, \"a basis from which the shortest period can be rigorously calculated, with all larger units of time expressed as multiples of that period.\" Once the Traditionalists carried the day with their historical reconstructions of the Earth-standard clock, extensive scientific exploration of the region lapsed in importance, and today the region\'s large number of pulsars and other stellar phenomena are largely considered merely a curiosity.'),(10000064,'\"The Federation is not a defined region of space, of planets, of mountains, rivers, or woods.
