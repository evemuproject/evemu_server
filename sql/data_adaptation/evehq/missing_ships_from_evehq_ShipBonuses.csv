15% bonus to ECM Target Jammer strength per level

20% bonus to ECM Target Jammer optimal and falloff range per level

<font color=white><u>Details</u></font>

This variant of the Scorpion represents the pinnacle of the Ishukone paramilitary force's electronic warfare capabilities.

 

<font color=white><u>Development</u></font>

When Ishukone Watch was commissioned to produce a run of Scorpion-class battleships for its parent company, it was decided that a number of extra units would be offered to the capsuleer community to help fund the effort. Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet's production.

 

<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>

Though the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special LADAR and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces. Although these features are stripped out before decommissioned hulls are placed on the open market, the infamy of the Ishukone Watch still makes ships popular with independent ship buyers.



<font color=white><u>Notes</u></font>

Many wonder why Ishukone Watch would produce a massive run of electronic warfare battleships, especially with sensor suites fine-tuned to detect planetside signals. Some have speculated that these ships were intended to support a larger, multinational fleet. Regarding the mass production of these ships, Ishukone Watch CEO Eborimi Shiskala praised her parent corporation with an ""incredible dedication to the Ishukone doctrine of technological superiority.""

2078,1022,Zephyr,"The Zephyr is a unique starship design, relying almost entirely on solar winds for sublight propulsion. Super-light sails allow it to ride the torrents of photons streaming through space, and its barebones construction gives it a tiny sensor footprint and almost negligible mass.



Originally conceived by the ascetic Intaki polymath Valsas en Dilat as a demonstration of minimalist starship design, it was never intended as a commercial venture. The recent discovery of the uncharted Sleeper Territories and their myriad wormholes has brought the Zephyr new attention - its mass makes it an ideal exploration vessel.



Valsas remains adamant that the Zephyr never sees mass production, but at the close of YC111 he authorized the Intaki Syndicate to distribute a single hull to every registered capsuleer.



Note: Can fit Prototype Iris Probe Launcher; will not be targeted by Sleeper drones.",4517,60,5000,5000,10,1,8,50000000,1,1395,0.07,0,0,16691369,105429,93946
