 *
 * One of the key things of the ZLIB stuff is that we 'sometimes'
 * don't know the size of the uncompressed data. My idea is to fix
 * this regarding the first phase of the parsing of the data
 * (the parser) is to go trough a couple of output buffer size.
 *
 * The first buffer size would be 2x the initial buffer size,
 * implying that the compression ratio is about 50%.
 * The second buffer size would be 4x the initial buffer size,
 * implying that the compression ratio is about 75%.
 * The third buffer size would be 8x the initial buffer size
 * implying that the compression ratio is about 87.5%.
 *
 * We would go on in this progress until we find buffer size
 * big enough to hold uncompressed data.
 *
 * This theory is really stupid because there is no way to actually know.
 *
 * @param[in]  input  Data to be inflated.
 * @param[out] output Destination for inflated data.
 *
 * @retval true  Inflation ran successfully.
 * @retval false Failed to inflate data.
